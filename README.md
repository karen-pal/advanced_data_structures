in build_and_search_kd_tree.py you can find the code corresponding to the implementation in python of the pseudocode given as an answer to the point number 6 of the test.

> Number 6
> Give a high-level description (but detailed enough) of the algorithm to
> find all elements in a standard K-d tree that are at (Euclidean) distance of q not
> larger than a given radius R. In your algorithm, take into account that there is no
> need to store discriminants in the nodes of the standard K-d tree; they cycle along
> any path: 0, 1, 2, . . . , K âˆ’ 1, 0, 1, . . .


It runs the algorithm for the following 2D KDtree

```python
Root: (51, 75)
    Left:  (25, 40)
        Left:  (10, 30)
            Left:  (1, 10)
        Right: (35, 90)
    Right: (70, 70)
        Left:  (55, 1)
        Right: (60, 80)
